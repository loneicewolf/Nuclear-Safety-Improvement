## About

### Important Note: I’m not a nuclear expert or professional.

I’m just a curious individual exploring ways to enhance nuclear reactor safety and transparency, much like open-source projects. This repository shares ideas aimed at improving safety and working conditions in nuclear facilities. Some suggestions focus on individual well-being, while others propose creating new departments, such as a specialized fire department trained for handling radioactive incidents.

Feel free to browse the ideas and contribute if you have suggestions or feedback!

### Who Am I?

I’m Will, a 24-year-old from Sweden with an interest in nuclear safety. I don’t have a background in nuclear science or reactor operations, but I’m passionate about making things more open and transparent, akin to open-source principles. My ideas range from enhancing worker safety to proposing new departments like a dedicated fire department for nuclear incidents.
